 * @property {string}
 * [deploymentConfiguration.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSkuId] The
 * Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
 * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
 * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported

 * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
 * @property {number} [currentDedicatedNodes] The number of compute nodes
 * currently in the pool.
 * @property {number} [currentLowPriorityNodes] The number of low priority
 * compute nodes currently in the pool.
 * @property {object} [scaleSettings] Settings which configure the number of
 * nodes in the pool.
 * @property {object} [scaleSettings.fixedScale] This property and autoScale
 * are mutually exclusive and one of the properties must be specified.
 * @property {moment.duration} [scaleSettings.fixedScale.resizeTimeout] The
 * default value is 15 minutes. Timeout values use ISO 8601 format. For
 * example, use PT10M for 10 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you
 * specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the request
 * with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status
 * code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @property {number} [scaleSettings.fixedScale.targetDedicatedNodes] At least
 * one of targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriority nodes must be set.
 * @property {number} [scaleSettings.fixedScale.targetLowPriorityNodes] At

 * Codes are invariant and are intended to be consumed programmatically.
 * @property {string} [autoScaleRun.error.message] A message describing the
 * error, intended to be suitable for display in a user interface.
 * @property {array} [autoScaleRun.error.details]
 * @property {string} [interNodeCommunication] Whether the pool permits direct
 * communication between nodes. This imposes restrictions on which nodes can be
 * assigned to the pool. Enabling this value can reduce the chance of the
 * requested number of nodes to be allocated in the pool. If not specified,
 * this value defaults to 'Disabled'. Possible values include: 'Enabled',
 * 'Disabled'
 * @property {object} [networkConfiguration] The network configuration for the
 * pool.
 * @property {string} [networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network must
 * be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The
 * specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the
 * number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP
 * addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
 * error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the
 * 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role
 * for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from
 * the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes.
 * This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated
 * Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the
 * specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the
 * state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created via
 * virtualMachineConfiguration the Batch account must have poolAllocationMode
 * userSubscription in order to use a VNet. If the specified VNet has any
 * associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports
 * must be enabled for inbound communication. For pools created with a virtual
 * machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for
 * Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For pools created with a cloud service
 * configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound
 * connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @property {object} [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration] Pool
 * endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @property {array}
 * [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNatPools] The maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum number of
 * inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status code 400.
 * @property {number} [maxTasksPerNode] The maximum number of tasks that can
 * run concurrently on a single compute node in the pool.
 * @property {object} [taskSchedulingPolicy] How tasks are distributed across
 * compute nodes in a pool.
 * @property {string} [taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType] Possible values
 * include: 'Spread', 'Pack'
 * @property {array} [userAccounts] The list of user accounts to be created on
 * each node in the pool.
 * @property {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
 * pool as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata;
 * it is solely for the use of user code.
 * @property {object} [startTask] A task specified to run on each compute node
 * as it joins the pool. In an PATCH (update) operation, this property can be
 * set to an empty object to remove the start task from the pool.
 * @property {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. Required
 * if any other properties of the startTask are specified.
 * @property {array} [startTask.resourceFiles]
 * @property {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
 * @property {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as a
 * non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @property {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @property {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @property {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool - specifies
 * that the task runs as the common auto user account which is created on every
 * node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should create a new user
 * for the task. The default value is task. Possible values include: 'Task',
 * 'Pool'
 * @property {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] nonAdmin
 * - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin - The auto
 * user is a user with elevated access and operates with full Administrator
 * permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include:
 * 'NonAdmin', 'Admin'
 * @property {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
 * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls
 * the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
 * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
 * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
 * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the
 * maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
 * @property {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
 * scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @property {array} [certificates] The list of certificates to be installed on
 * each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service
 * installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location.
 * For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside
 * the task working directory and an environment variable
 * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
 * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
 * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 * @property {array} [applicationPackages] The list of application packages to
 * be installed on each compute node in the pool. Changes to application
 * packages affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do not affect
 * compute nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or
 * reimaged.
 * @property {array} [applicationLicenses] The list of application licenses the
 * Batch service will make available on each compute node in the pool. The list
 * of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service
 * application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool
 * creation will fail.
 * @property {object} [resizeOperationStatus] Contains details about the
 * current or last completed resize operation.
 * @property {number} [resizeOperationStatus.targetDedicatedNodes]
 * @property {number} [resizeOperationStatus.targetLowPriorityNodes]
 * @property {moment.duration} [resizeOperationStatus.resizeTimeout] The
 * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you specify
 * a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service returns an error; if you are
 * calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @property {string} [resizeOperationStatus.nodeDeallocationOption] The
 * default value is requeue. Possible values include: 'Requeue', 'Terminate',
 * 'TaskCompletion', 'RetainedData'
 * @property {date} [resizeOperationStatus.startTime]
 * @property {array} [resizeOperationStatus.errors] This property is set only
 * if an error occurred during the last pool resize, and only when the pool
 * allocationState is Steady.
