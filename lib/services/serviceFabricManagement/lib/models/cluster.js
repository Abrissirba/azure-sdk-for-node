   * the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding
   * applications of application types that are included in the
   * ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * applications. Default percentage is zero.

   * The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to
   * make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.
   * @member {number}
   * [upgradeDescription.deltaHealthPolicy.maxPercentUpgradeDomainDeltaUnhealthyNodes]
   * The maximum allowed percentage of upgrade domain nodes health degradation
   * allowed during cluster upgrades.
   * The delta is measured between the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the

   * all completed upgrade domains to make sure the state of the upgrade
   * domains is within tolerated limits.
   * @member {number}
   * [upgradeDescription.deltaHealthPolicy.maxPercentDeltaUnhealthyApplications]
   * The maximum allowed percentage of applications health degradation allowed
   * during cluster upgrades.

   * make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.
   * System services are not included in this.
   * @member {object}
   * [upgradeDescription.deltaHealthPolicy.applicationDeltaHealthPolicies]
   * Defines the application delta health policy map used to evaluate the
   * health of an application or one of its child entities when upgrading the
   * cluster.
   * @member {string} [upgradeMode] The upgrade mode of the cluster when new
   * Service Fabric runtime version is available.
   *
   * - Automatic - The cluster will be automatically upgraded to the latest
   * Service Fabric runtime version as soon as it is available.
   * - Manual - The cluster will not be automatically upgraded to the latest
   * Service Fabric runtime version. The cluster is upgraded by setting the
   * **clusterCodeVersion** property in the cluster resource.
