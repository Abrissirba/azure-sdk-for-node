   * @member {string} [upgradeDescription.upgradeReplicaSetCheckTimeout] The
   * maximum amount of time to block processing of an upgrade domain and revent
   * loss of availability when there are unexpected issues. When this timeout

   * format.
   * @member {string} [upgradeDescription.healthCheckWaitDuration] The length

   * policy used when upgrading the cluster.
   * @member {number}
   * [upgradeDescription.healthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyNodes] The maximum
   * allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before reporting an error. For
   * example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that
   * can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node,
   * the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes
   * over the total number of nodes in the cluster.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * nodes. Default percentage is zero.
   *
   * In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so
   * this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.
   * @member {number}
   * [upgradeDescription.healthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyApplications] The
   * maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications before reporting an
   * error. For example, to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this
   * value would be 10.
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications
   * that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * application, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over
   * the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding
   * applications of application types that are included in the
   * ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * applications. Default percentage is zero.
   * @member {object}
   * [upgradeDescription.healthPolicy.applicationHealthPolicies] Defines the
   * application health policy map used to evaluate the health of an
   * application or one of its children entities.
   * @member {object} [upgradeDescription.deltaHealthPolicy] The cluster delta
   * health policy used when upgrading the cluster.
   * @member {number}
   * [upgradeDescription.deltaHealthPolicy.maxPercentDeltaUnhealthyNodes] The
   * maximum allowed percentage of nodes health degradation allowed during
   * cluster upgrades.
   * The delta is measured between the state of the nodes at the beginning of
   * upgrade and the state of the nodes at the time of the health evaluation.
   * The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to
   * make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.
   * @member {number}
   * [upgradeDescription.deltaHealthPolicy.maxPercentUpgradeDomainDeltaUnhealthyNodes]
   * The maximum allowed percentage of upgrade domain nodes health degradation
   * allowed during cluster upgrades.
   * The delta is measured between the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the
   * beginning of upgrade and the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the time
   * of the health evaluation.
   * The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion for
   * all completed upgrade domains to make sure the state of the upgrade
   * domains is within tolerated limits.
   * @member {number}
   * [upgradeDescription.deltaHealthPolicy.maxPercentDeltaUnhealthyApplications]
   * The maximum allowed percentage of applications health degradation allowed
   * during cluster upgrades.
   * The delta is measured between the state of the applications at the
   * beginning of upgrade and the state of the applications at the time of the
   * health evaluation.
   * The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to
   * make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.
   * System services are not included in this.
   * @member {object}
   * [upgradeDescription.deltaHealthPolicy.applicationDeltaHealthPolicies]
   * Defines the application delta health policy map used to evaluate the
   * health of an application or one of its child entities when upgrading the
   * cluster.
   * @member {string} [upgradeMode] The upgrade mode of the cluster when new
   * Service Fabric runtime version is available.
   *
   * - Automatic - The cluster will be automatically upgraded to the latest
   * Service Fabric runtime version as soon as it is available.
   * - Manual - The cluster will not be automatically upgraded to the latest
   * Service Fabric runtime version. The cluster is upgraded by setting the
   * **clusterCodeVersion** property in the cluster resource.
   * . Possible values include: 'Automatic', 'Manual'
