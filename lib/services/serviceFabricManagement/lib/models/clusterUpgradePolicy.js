class ClusterUpgradePolicy {
  /**
   * Create a ClusterUpgradePolicy.
   * @member {boolean} [forceRestart] If true, then processes are forcefully
   * restarted during upgrade even when the code version has not changed (the
   * upgrade only changes configuration or data).
   * @member {string} upgradeReplicaSetCheckTimeout The maximum amount of time
   * to block processing of an upgrade domain and revent loss of availability
   * when there are unexpected issues. When this timeout expires, processing of
   * the upgrade domain will proceed regardless of availability loss issues.
   * The timeout is reset at the start of each upgrade domain. The timeout can
   * be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
   * @member {string} healthCheckWaitDuration The length of time to wait after
   * completing an upgrade domain before performing health checks. The duration
   * can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
   * @member {string} healthCheckStableDuration The amount of time that the
   * application or cluster must remain healthy before the upgrade proceeds to
   * the next upgrade domain. The duration can be in either hh:mm:ss or in
   * d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
   * @member {string} healthCheckRetryTimeout The amount of time to retry
   * health evaluation when the application or cluster is unhealthy before the
   * upgrade rolls back. The timeout can be in either hh:mm:ss or in
   * d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
   * @member {string} upgradeTimeout The amount of time the overall upgrade has
   * to complete before the upgrade rolls back. The timeout can be in either
   * hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
   * @member {string} upgradeDomainTimeout The amount of time each upgrade
   * domain has to complete before the upgrade rolls back. The timeout can be
   * in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
   * @member {object} healthPolicy The cluster health policy used when
   * upgrading the cluster.
   * @member {number} [healthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyNodes] The maximum
   * allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before reporting an error. For
   * example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that
   * can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node,
   * the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes
   * over the total number of nodes in the cluster.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * nodes. Default percentage is zero.
   *
   * In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so
   * this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.
   * @member {number} [healthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyApplications] The
   * maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications before reporting an
   * error. For example, to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this
   * value would be 10.
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications
   * that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * application, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over
   * the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding
   * applications of application types that are included in the
   * ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * applications. Default percentage is zero.
   * @member {array} [healthPolicy.applicationHealthPolicies] Defines the
   * application health policy map used to evaluate the health of an
   * application or one of its children entities.
   * @member {object} [deltaHealthPolicy] The cluster delta health policy used
   * when upgrading the cluster.
   * @member {number} [deltaHealthPolicy.maxPercentDeltaUnhealthyNodes] The
   * maximum allowed percentage of nodes health degradation allowed during
   * cluster upgrades.
   * The delta is measured between the state of the nodes at the beginning of
   * upgrade and the state of the nodes at the time of the health evaluation.
   * The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to
   * make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.
   * @member {number}
   * [deltaHealthPolicy.maxPercentUpgradeDomainDeltaUnhealthyNodes] The maximum
   * allowed percentage of upgrade domain nodes health degradation allowed
   * during cluster upgrades.
   * The delta is measured between the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the
   * beginning of upgrade and the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the time
   * of the health evaluation.
   * The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion for
   * all completed upgrade domains to make sure the state of the upgrade
   * domains is within tolerated limits.
   * @member {number} [deltaHealthPolicy.maxPercentDeltaUnhealthyApplications]
   * The maximum allowed percentage of applications health degradation allowed
   * during cluster upgrades.
   * The delta is measured between the state of the applications at the
   * beginning of upgrade and the state of the applications at the time of the
   * health evaluation.
   * The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to
   * make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.
   * System services are not included in this.
   * @member {array} [deltaHealthPolicy.applicationDeltaHealthPolicies] Defines
   * the application delta health policy map used to evaluate the health of an
   * application or one of its child entities when upgrading the cluster.
