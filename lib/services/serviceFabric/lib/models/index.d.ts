 * so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.
 * The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a
 * property "Connectivity" on the same node.
 * In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for
 * the specified node.
 *
 * Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health
 * information.
 * @property {string} healthState The health state of a Service Fabric entity
 * such as Cluster, Node, Application, Service, Partition, Replica etc.
 * Possible values include: 'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'
 * @property {moment.duration} [timeToLiveInMilliSeconds] The duration for
 * which this health report is valid. This field uses ISO8601 format for
 * specifying the duration.
 * When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher
 * frequency than time to live.
 * If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite.
 * When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health
 * information
 * is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or
 * evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false.
 *
 * If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value.
 * @property {string} [description] The description of the health information.
 * It represents free text used to add human readable information about the
 * report.
 * The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters.
 * If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated.
 * When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker
 * "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters.
 * The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred.
 * Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from
 * the original string.
 * @property {string} [sequenceNumber] The sequence number for this health
 * report as a numeric string.
 * The report sequence number is used by the health store to detect stale
 * reports.
 * If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client
 * when a report is added.
 * @property {boolean} [removeWhenExpired] Value that indicates whether the
 * report is removed from health store when it expires.
 * If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it
 * expires.
 * If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value
 * of this property is false by default.
 * When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false
 * (default).
 * This way, is the reporter has issues (eg. deadlock) and can't report, the
 * entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires.
 * This flags the entity as being in Error health state.

 *
 * In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so

 * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications
 * that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
 * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy

 * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
 * applications. Default percentage is zero.
 * @property {array} [clusterHealthPolicy.applicationTypeHealthPolicyMap]
 * Defines a map with max percentage unhealthy applications for specific
 * application types.
 * Each entry specifies as key the application type name and as value an
 * integer that represents the MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications percentage used
 * to evaluate the applications of the specified application type.
 *
 * The application type health policy map can be used during cluster health
 * evaluation to describe special application types.
 * The application types included in the map are evaluated against the
 * percentage specified in the map, and not with the global
 * MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications defined in the cluster health policy.
 * The applications of application types specified in the map are not counted
 * against the global pool of applications.
 * For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster
 * administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type
 * and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures).
 * All other applications can be evaluated with MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications
 * set to 20% to tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application
 * instances.
 * The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster manifest
 * enables application type health evaluation using the configuration entry for
 * HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation.
 * @property {object} [clusterUpgradeHealthPolicy] Defines a health policy used
 * to evaluate the health of the cluster during a cluster upgrade.
 * @property {number}
 * [clusterUpgradeHealthPolicy.maxPercentDeltaUnhealthyNodes] The maximum
 * allowed percentage of nodes health degradation allowed during cluster

 * beginning of upgrade and the state of the nodes at the time of the health
 * evaluation. The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade
 * completion to make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated
 * limits. The default value is 10%.
 * @property {number}
 * [clusterUpgradeHealthPolicy.maxPercentUpgradeDomainDeltaUnhealthyNodes] The
 * maximum allowed percentage of upgrade domain nodes health degradation
 * allowed during cluster upgrades. The delta is measured between the state of
 * the upgrade domain nodes at the beginning of upgrade and the state of the
 * upgrade domain nodes at the time of the health evaluation. The check is
 * performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion for all completed
 * upgrade domains to make sure the state of the upgrade domains is within
 * tolerated limits. The default value is 15%.
 * @property {array} [applicationHealthPolicyMap] Defines a map that contains
 * specific application health policies for different applications.
 * Each entry specifies as key the application name and as value an
 * ApplicationHealthPolicy used to evaluate the application health.
 * If an application is not specified in the map, the application health
 * evaluation uses the ApplicationHealthPolicy found in its application
 * manifest or the default application health policy (if no health policy is
 * defined in the manifest).
 * The map is empty by default.

 * @property {number} [chaosParameters.maxConcurrentFaults] MaxConcurrentFaults
 * is the maximum number of concurrent faults induced per iteration.

 *
 * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications
 * that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
 * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
 * application, the health is evaluated as Warning.
 * This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over the

 * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
 * applications. Default percentage is zero.
 * @property {array}

 * a map with max percentage unhealthy applications for specific application
 * types.
 * Each entry specifies as key the application type name and as value an
 * integer that represents the MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications percentage used
 * to evaluate the applications of the specified application type.
 *
 * The application type health policy map can be used during cluster health
 * evaluation to describe special application types.
 * The application types included in the map are evaluated against the
 * percentage specified in the map, and not with the global
 * MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications defined in the cluster health policy.
 * The applications of application types specified in the map are not counted
 * against the global pool of applications.
 * For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster
 * administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type
 * and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures).
 * All other applications can be evaluated with MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications
 * set to 20% to tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application
