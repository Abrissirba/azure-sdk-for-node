class TaskUpdateParameter {
  /**
   * Create a TaskUpdateParameter.
   * @member {object} [constraints] Constraints that apply to this task. If
   * omitted, the task is given the default constraints. For multi-instance
   * tasks, updating the retention time applies only to the primary task and
   * not subtasks.
   * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
   * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
   * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is
   * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
   * is removed or reimaged.
   * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
   * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try
   * the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
   * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
   * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service
   * does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
   * service retries the task without limit. ResourceFiles and
   * AppplicationPackages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a
   * new compute node. Batch will also retry tasks when a recovery operation is
   * triggered on a compute node. Examples of recovery operations triggers
   * include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy compute node is
   * rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to
   * recovery operation are independent of and are not counted against
   * maxTaskRetryCount. All tasks should be idempotent, it means they need to
   * tolerate being interrupted and restarted, without causing any corruption
   * or duplicate data. Best practices recommended for long running tasks is to
   * use checkpointing.
